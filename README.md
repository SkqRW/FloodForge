# FloodForge

FloodForge is a C++ remake of a few Rain World modding tools.

It aims for intuitive controls, clean ui, and as few dependencies as possible.

## Building

### Windows

Requirements:

- [MSYS2 MINGW](https://www.msys2.org)

#### One time build

If you want to have a permanent executable that you can run whenever, use this option.
`sh build.sh`

#### Building for debugging

Use this if you are editing the code and need to quickly test
`sh build.sh --debug`

### Shell script

The build.sh script also works under Msys2.

First, install Make:

```bash
pacman -S make
```

Then refer to the Linux build instructions.

### Linux

Install:

```bash
sudo apt-get install make
sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev
sudo apt-get install pkg-config
sudo apt-get install g++
sudo apt-get install libutf8proc-dev
```

Build:

```bash
sh Build.sh

# build in debug mode
sh Build.sh --debug

# build in release mode
sh Build.sh --release
```
